      <h1>about</h1>
      <p>I'm Sam — a digital native who loves taking data and turning it into something more... human.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, I've helped creative teams and SaaS brands understand what's working (and what's not) through post-launch insights, onboarding strategy, and custom performance tools.</p>
      <p>Now I'm focusing on creative strategy — using campaign data, short-form trends, and user behaviour to build more resonant, more effective work </p>
      <p>This site is my digital garden — part portfolio, part zine, part experiment.</p>
