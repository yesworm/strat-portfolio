        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p><strong>🚨 Problem:</strong> Ad traffic landed but didn't convert.</p>
        <p><strong>💡 Insight:</strong> Users rarely scrolled, and PDPs were slow.</p>
        <p><strong>🎯 Fix:</strong> Curated PLPs, faster PDPs, and data-led tweaks.</p>

        <p><strong>They had the traffic. But not the traction.</strong></p>
        <p>Brolly Goods Co. had just relaunched their ecommerce site. Paid campaigns were working — sessions were strong, but conversions lagged. Product pages weren't being seen. Carts stayed empty. This is what we uncovered, and what we optimised.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="zine-problem">
        <h2>🚨 The Problem</h2>
        <p>Product listing pages (PLPs) weren't converting. Product detail pages (PDPs) were barely being reached. Despite great creative and solid inventory, users weren't making it past the first scroll.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="zine-insight">
        <h2>🔍 The Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>📉 Scroll fatigue:</strong> Most mobile users dropped off after the third product row.</li>
          <li><strong>🐢 Slow PDPs:</strong> Nearly 40% of product pages took over 3s to load.</li>
          <li><strong>🎯 Missed conversion cues:</strong> Some high-interest products had low add-to-cart rates due to missing trust elements or poor image setups.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="zine-fix">
        <h2>🛠️ The Fix</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Built curated landing pages to better match campaign traffic</li>
          <li>Optimised PDP load speed and added inline reviews + delivery info</li>
          <li>Redesigned PLPs to prioritise high-performing products early</li>
          <li>Tracked scroll depth and product visibility to guide future decisions</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="zine-impact">
        <h2>📈 The Impact</h2>
        <p>Product page views increased by 28%, add-to-cart rose by 17%, and mobile conversions improved by 9% over 4 weeks. Cross-sell CTR doubled after PDP adjustments.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="zine-tools">
        <h2>🧰 Tools & Methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GA4 for funnel mapping and traffic segmentation</li>

      <section class="zine-takeaway">
        <h2>🌱 Takeaway</h2>
        <p>The launch is just the beginning. Strategic insight post-launch is where real growth lives. Scroll data, PDP friction, and product-level conversion insights helped turn this ecommerce experience from pretty to performant.</p>
