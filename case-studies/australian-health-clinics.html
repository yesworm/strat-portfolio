    <section class="zine-problem">
      <h2>🚨 The Problem</h2>
      <p>After launching a sleek new booking flow, Australian Health Clinics began receiving feedback that patients were abandoning the process midway—especially on mobile devices. The client had GA4 tracking in place, but the agency wasn't sure how to interpret the data or identify where the issue was occurring.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="zine-insight">
      <h2>🔍 The Insight</h2>
      <p>Using GA4's event funneling and screen size dimensions, we uncovered that the form step was the main friction point. Drop-offs peaked during insurance selection, which wasn't clearly marked as optional. On smaller screens, help text was obscured by the mobile keyboard. Additionally, users misinterpreted the final “confirmation” screen as a form error due to a lack of visual feedback.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="zine-fix">
      <h2>🛠️ The Fix</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reordered form fields to surface essentials above the fold</li>
        <li>Added clear labels for optional vs required inputs</li>
        <li>Improved validation and confirmation states</li>
        <li>Reduced total fields by 30% by eliminating low-value inputs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  
    <section class="zine-impact">
      <h2>📈 The Impact</h2>
      <p>Mobile conversion rates increased by 22% within 30 days of deployment. Time to complete bookings decreased by 27%, and patient rebooking rates improved in follow-up email campaigns. The agency secured a 6-month optimisation retainer based on performance lift.</p>

    <section class="zine-takeaway">
      <h2>🌱 Takeaway</h2>
      <p>Optimisation isn't just technical - it's about clarity, confidence, and minimizing effort. Small improvements grounded in real user behaviour can unlock long-term value for both clients and agencies.</p>
